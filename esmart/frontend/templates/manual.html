		<a name="sensors"></a>
		<h2>Sensors</h2>

		<p>Sensors will acquire environmental measurements, which will be used to create historical logs and provide the mos recent measurement for any PID controllers to operate from, allowing modulation of relays to regulate the environment.</p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Name</dt>
      <dd>This is a unique name you can give this sensor, which will allow you to easily recognize it with a familiar name.</dd>

      <dt>Device</dt>
      <dd>If there is support for more than one of a particular type of sensor, select which sensor is being used.</dd>

      <dt>Location</dt>
      <dd>Depending on what sensor is being used, you will need to either enter the serial number (in the case of the DS18B20 temperature sensor), the GPIO pin (in the case of sensors read by a GPIO), or the I<sup>2</sup>C address and channel if using the TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer.</dd>

      <dt>Read Period</dt>
      <dd>After the sensor is successfully read and a log entry is made, this is the duration of time that is waited until the sensor is measured again for a log entry.</dd>

      <dt>Pre Relay</dt>
      <dd>If you require a relay to be activated before a measurement is made (for instance, if you have a pump that extracts air to a chamber where the sensor resides), this is the relay number that will be activated. The relay will be activated for a duration defined by the Pre Duration, then once the relay turns off, a measurement by the sensor is made.</dd>

      <dt>Pre Relay Duration</dt>
      <dd>This is the duration of time that the Pre Relay runs for before the sensor measurement is obtained.</dd>
    </dl>

		<div style="padding: 0.3em"></div>

		<h4 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sensor Verification</h4>

		<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">This allows the verification of a sensor's measurement with another sensor's measurement. This feature is best utilized when you have two sensors in the same location (ideally as close as possible). One sensor (host) should be set up to use the other sensor (slave) to verify. The host sensor should be used to operate the PID, as one feature of the verification is the ability to disable the PID if the difference between measurements is not within the range specificed.</p>

		<dl class="dl-horizontal" style="text-decoration: line-through;">
      <dt>GPIO</dt>
      <dd>This is the sensor that will be used to verify the sensor measurement. The sensor will be read directly after the first sensor's measurement to verify whether the sensors have similar measurements.</dd>

      <dt>Difference</dt>
      <dd>This is the maximum measured measurement difference between the two sensors before an action is triggered (either notify by email or prevent PID from operating; more below).</dd>

      <dt>Notification</dt>
      <dd>If the measurements of the two sensors differ by more than the set <i>Difference</i>, an email will be sent to the address in the <i>Notification</i> field.</dd>

      <dt>Stop PID</dt>
      <dd>If the measurements of the two sensors differ by more than the set <i>Difference</i>, the PID controller will turn off.</dd>
    </dl>

		<a name="relays"></a>
		<h2>Relays</h2>

		<p>Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger voltage, without exposing the low -voltage system to the dangers of the higher voltage.</p>

		<p>Relays must be properly set up before PID regulation can be achieved. Add and configure relays in the Sensor tab. Set the "GPIO Pin" to the BCM GPIO number of each pin that activates each relay. <i>On Trigger</i> should be set to the signal that activates the relay (closes the relay circuit). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 0-volts, set <i>On Trigger</i> to "Low", otherwise if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 5-volts, set it to "High".</p>

		<a name="conditional-statements"></a>
		<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>

		<p>A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for both relays and sensors. Possible conditional statements include:</p>

		<p>
		If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #3 ON<br>
		If Relay #1 turns OFF, turn Relay #3 OFF<br>
		If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify critical-issue@domain.com<br>
		If Relay #2 turns ON, turn Relay #4 ON for 21 seconds<br>
		If Relay #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Relay #5 ON for 50 seconds<br>
		If Relay #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Relay #1 OFF<br>
		If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds<br>
		If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Relay #1 ON for 21 seconds, execute '/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh', and notify minor-issue@domain.com<br>
		</p>

		<p>Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it"s advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to the relays. Some devices or relays may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, avoid creating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28computing%29#Infinite_loops" target="_blank">infinite loop</a> with conditional statements.</p>

		<a name="timers"></a>
		<h2>Timers</h2>

		<p>Timers enable a relay to be switched on and off at specific durations or at a specific time of the day. For <em>Duration Timers</em>, both the on duration and the off duration can be defined and the timer will be turned on and off for those durations until deactivated. For <em>Daily Timers</em>, the start hour:minute can be set to turn a specific realy on or off at the specific time of day.</p>

		<a name="pid"></a>
		<h2>PIDs</h2>

		<dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Activate</dt>
      <dd>Turn a particular PID controller on or off.</dd>

      <dt>Setpoint</dt>
      <dd>This is the specific point you would like the environment to be regaulted at. For example, if you would like the humidity regulated to 60%, enter 60.</dd>

      <dt>Regulate Direction</dt>
      <dd>This is the direction that you wish to regulate. For example, if you only require the temperature to be raised, set this to "Up," but if you require regulation up and down, set this to "Both."</dd>

      <dt>Period</dt>
      <dd>This is the duration between when the PID relay turns off amd when the sensor takes another measurement, the PID is updated, and the relay is turned on again for another duration.</dd>

      <dt>Raise Relay</dt>
      <dd>This is the relay that will cause the particular environmental condition to rise. In the case of raising the temperature, this may be a heating pad or coil.</dd>

      <dt>Min Duration (raise)</dt>
      <dd>This is the minimum that the PID output must be before the Up Relay turns on. If the PID output exceeds this minimum, the Up Relay will turn on for the PID output number of seconds.</dd>

      <dt>Max Duration (raise)</dt>
      <dd>This is the maximum duration the Up Relay is allowed to turn on for. if the PID output exceeds this number, the Up Relay will turn on for no greater than this duration of time.</dd>

      <dt>Lower Relay</dt>
      <dd>This is the relay that will cause the particular environmental condition to lower. In the case of lowering the CO<sub>2</sub>, this may be an exhaust fan.</dd>

      <dt>Min Duration (lower)</dt>
      <dd>This is the minimum that the PID output must be before the Down Relay turns on. If the PID output exceeds this minimum, the Down Relay will turn on for the PID output number of seconds.</dd>

		<h2>PID Tuning</h2>

		<a name="pid-control-theory"></a>
		<h3>PID Control Theory</h3>

		<p>The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative.</p>

		<p>The <b>P</b>roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K<sub>p</sub>, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output.</p>

		<p>The <b>I</b>ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K<sub>i</sub>, then integrates it (K<sub>i</sub> · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K<sub>i</sub>. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K<sub>p</sub> alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.</p>

		<p>The <b>D</b>erivative multiplies the error by K<sub>d</sub>, then differentiates it (K<sub>d</sub> · s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.</p>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller" target="_blank"><img src="/static/img/PIDAnimation.gif"></a></p>

		<p>Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i>). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is eessentially turned off.</p>

		<p>The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the ouput to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a <i>properly tuned</i> PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.</p>

		<p>Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be aceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.</p>

		<p>Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> activated, then experiment with <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.</p>

		<a name="quick-set-up-examples"></a>
		<h3>Quick Set-up Examples</h3>

		<p>These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your <i>K<sub>P</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as <a href="http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.</p>

		<p>Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 30, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 1.0, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 1.0, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 0.2, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.</p>

		<a name="exact-temperature-regulation"></a>
		<h3>Exact Temperature Regulation</h3>

		<p>This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools).</p>

		<p>Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor.</p>

		<p>Add two relays, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.</p>

		<p>Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change <i>Setpoint</i> to the desired temperature, <i>Regulate Direction</i> to "Both". Set <i>Raise Relay</i> to the relay attached to the heating device and the <i>Lower Relay</i> to the relay attached to the coolong device.</p>

		<p>Set <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> = 1, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> = 0, and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 0, then activate the PID.</p>

		<p>If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only <i>Read Interval</i> and <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> alone.</p>

		<p>View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint.</p>

		<p>Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> slightly (~25%) and increasing <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> value can be experimented with once both <i>K<sub>P</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>I</sub></i> have been tuned.</p>

		<a name="high-temperature-regulation"></a>
		<h3>High Temperature Regulation</h3>

		<p>Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used.</p>

		<p>Use the same configuration as the <a href="#exact-temperature-regulation">Exact Temperature Regulation</a> example, except change <i>Regulate Direction</i> to "Raise" and do not touch the "Down Relay" section.</p>

		<a name="system-restore"></a>
		<h3>System Restore</h3>

		<p>If you need to restore a backup, do the following, changing the appropriate directory names with these commands, changing 'user' to your user name:

		<pre>sudo mv /home/user/eSmart /home/user/eSmart_old
sudo cp -a /var/eSmart-backups/eSmart-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/eSmart
sudo service esmart restart
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</pre>

		<h3>Preserving Custom Code</h3>

		As per the <a href="https://github.com/elog11/eSmart/issues/25#issuecomment-143360432" target="_blank">work done by Boomstick8x</a>, the process to preserve custom code edits and restore them after a eSmart update is below. Be aware that this method does not guarantee the successful operation of eSmart after restoring custom code, as it can't be unknown what is changed in an update. It's assumed that if you're producing custom code, you should also be familiar with analyzing the changes of an update to determine if your code edits will work.

    <h3>Luminosity Sensors</h3>

    <a name="TSL2561"></a>
    <h4>TSL2561</h4>

    <p>The TSL2561 SparkFun Luminosity Sensor Breakout is a sophisticated light sensor which has a flat response across most of the visible spectrum. Unlike simpler sensors, the TSL2561 measures both infrared and visible light to better approximate the response of the human eye. And because the TSL2561 is an integrating sensor (it soaks up light for a predetermined amount of time), it is capable of measuring both small and large amounts of light by changing the integration time.</p>

    <p>
    Specifications:
    <br>Light range: 0.1 - 40k+ Lux
    <br>Vin: 3V and a low supply
    <br>Max current: 0.6mA.
