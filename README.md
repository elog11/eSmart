# eSmart

## Environmental Regulation System

### Latest version: 4.0.18

eSmart is a remote monitoring and automated regulation system with a focus on modulating environmental conditions. It was built to run on the Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) and aims to be easy to install and set up.

The core system coordinates a diverse set of responses to sensor measurements, including actions such as camera captures, email notifications, relay activation/deactivation, regulation with PID control, and more. eSmart has been used for cultivating gourmet mushrooms, cultivating plants, culturing microorganisms, maintaining honey bee apiary homeostasis, incubating snake eggs and young animals, aging cheeses, fermenting foods, maintaining aquatic systems, and more.



## What is PID Control?

[![eSmart](http://kylegabriel.com/projects/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/eSmart-3.6.0-tango-Graph-2016-05-21-11-15-26.png)](http://kylegabriel.com/projects/)

A [proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.

In the top graph of the above screenshot visualizes the regulation of temperature in a sealed chamber. The red line is the desired temperature setpoint that has been configured (which also happens to have been configured to change over the course of each day). The blue line is the actual recorded temperature. The green vertical bars represent how long a heater is activated for, per every 20-second period. This regulation was achieved with minimal tuning (Actual tuned gains: K<sub>P</sub>=0.08, K<sub>I</sub>=0.005, K<sub>D</sub>=0.001), and already displays a very minimal deviation from the setpoint (±0.5° Celsius). Further tuning would reduce this variability even more.

## Install

These install procedures have been tested to work with a Raspberry Pi following a fresh intall of [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (Full or Lite version), with an active internet connection.

Set up the initial settings with raspi-config. **It's very important that you don't skip the file system expansion and reboot! This needs to be done before continuing or there won't be any free disk space.**

```sudo raspi-config```

 + Expand File system (required)**
 + Change User Password
 + Internationalisation Options -> Change Locale (set and select en_US.UTF-8 if US)
 + Internationalisation Options -> Change Timezone
 + Enable Camera
 + Advanced Options -> Enable I<sup>2</sup>C (required)
 + **Reboot (required)**


eSmart will be installed with the following install script (setup.sh). As a part of the instllation, it will install and modify the default apache2 configuration to host the eSmart web UI. If you require a custom setup, examine and modify this script accordingly. If you do not require a custom setup, just run the install script with the following commands.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git
cd
git clone https://github.com/elog11/eSmart
cd eSmart
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Create an administrator user for the web UI:

```sudo ./init_databases.py -A```

Make sure the setup.sh and init_databases.py scripts run without error. A log of the setup.sh script output will be created at ~/eSmart/setup.log.

Follow the on-screen prompts to create an administrator user for the web interface and then reboot.

```sudo shutdown now -r```

That's it. After the reboot, you should be able to use the user you just created to log into the eSmart web UI at https://localhost/ (note the 's' in https), with localhost changed to your Raspberry Pi's host or IP address. Once logged in, make sure the eSmart logo and version number at the top left is green, indicating the daemon is running. Red indicates the daemon is inactive or unresponsive. Ensure any java-blocking plugins are disabled for all the web UI features to work.



## Install Notes

If you want write access to the esmart files, add your user to the esmart group, changing 'username' to your user.

```sudo usermod -a -G esmart username```

In certain circumstances after the initial install, the esmart service will not be able to start because of a missing or corrupt package. I'm still trying to understand why this happens and how to prevent it. If you cannot start the daemon, try to resinstall the required modules with the following command:

```sudo pip install -r ~/eSmart/requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps```

Then reboot

```sudo shutdown now -r```

If you receive an unresolvable error during the install, please [create an issue](https://github.com/elog11/eSmart/issues).



## Supported Devices and Sensors

Certain sensors will require extra steps to be taken in order to set up the interface for communication. This includes I<sup>2</sup>C, one-wire, and UART.

### Temperature

> [Atlas Scientific PT-1000](http://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/temp_kit.html) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Industrial-grade temperature probe that can be indefinitely submersed in liquid and sustain extreme temperatures (-200˚C to 850˚C, with the use of a thermowell).

> [DS18B20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf) (1-wire): Once the one-wire interface has been configured with [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing), it may be used with eSmart.

> [TMP006, TMP007](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11859) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Can measure the temperature of an object without making contact with it, by using a thermopile to detect and absorb the infrared energy an object is emitting. This sensor also measures the temperature of the die (physical sensor).

### Humidity

> [AM2315](https://github.com/lexruee/tentacle_pi) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Measures relative humidity and temperature.

> [DHT11, DHT22, AM2302](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/wiring) (GPIO): Measures relative humidity and temperature.

> [HTU21D](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-HSC0004.html) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Measures relative humidity and temperature.

> [SHT1x, SHT2x, SHT7x](https://github.com/mk-fg/sht-sensor) (GPIO): Measures relative humidity and temperature.

### Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)

> [K30](http://www.co2meter.com/products/k-30-co2-sensor-module) (UART): Measures carbon dioxide in ppmv

[This documentation](http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN137-Raspberry-Pi.zip) provides specific installation procedures for the K30 with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2. Once the K30 has been configured with this documentation, it can be tested whether the sensor is able to be read, by executing ~/eSmart/esmart/tests/test_uart_K30.py

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions for getting the K30 working on the Raspberry Pi 3. If installing on a Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these steps to get the K30 working:

Run raspi-config

```sudo raspi-config```

Go to Advanced Options->Serial and disable. Then edit /boot/config.txt

```sudo vi /boot/config.txt```

Find the line "enable_uart=0" and change it to "enable_uart=1", then reboot.

### Pressure

> [BMP085, BMP180](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-bmp085-with-raspberry-pi) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Measures barometric pressure and temperature

### Luminosity

> [TSL2561](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12055) (I<sup>2</sup>C): A light sensor with a flat response across most of the visible spectrum. Light range from 0.1 - 40k+ Lux. Contains two integrating analog-to-digital converters (ADC) that integrate currents from two photodiodes to measure both infrared and visible light to better approximate the response of the human eye.

### Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both, actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect sensors, float switches, and more.


### Devices

### I<sup>2</sup>C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I<sup>2</sup>C bus need to have a unique address in order to communicate. Some sensors may have the same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to change the address, however the address range may be limited, which limits by how many you can use at the same time. I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexers are extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow multiple sensors with the same I<sup>2</sup>C address to be connected.

> [TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview) (I<sup>2</sup>C): Has 8 selectable addresses, so 8 multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address to be connected to each. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64 devices/sensors with the same address.

> [TCA9545A Grove I<sup>2</sup>C Bus Multiplexer](http://store.switchdoc.com/i2c-4-channel-mux-extender-expander-board-grove-pin-headers-for-arduino-and-raspberry-pi/) (I<sup>2</sup>C): This board works a little differently than the TCA9548A, ablove. This board actually creates new 4 new I<sup>2</sup>C busses, each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3 or 5.0 volts. Instructions to enable the Device Tree Overaly are at [https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a](https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a). Nothing else needs to be done in eSmart after that except to select the correct I<sup>2</sup>C bus when configuring the sensor.

### Analog to Digital Converters

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor that outputs a variable voltage. The detectable voltage range of this ADC is &plusmn;2.048 volts. A [voltage divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers) may be necessary to attain this range.

> [ADS1x15 Analog to Digital Converters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

> [MCP342x Analog to Digital Converters](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/MCP3424_18-Bit_ADC-4_Channel_with_Programmable_Gain_Amplifier_(SKU:DFR0316)) (I<sup>2</sup>C)



## Notes

A minimal set of anonymous usage statistics are collected to help improve development. No identifying information is saved from the information that is collected and it is only used to improve eSmart. No other sources will have access to this information. The data collected is mainly how much specific features are used, how often errors occur, and other similar statistics. The data that's collected can be viewed from the 'View collected statistics' link in the Settings/General panel of the UI or in the file eSmart/databases/statistics.csv. You may opt out from transmitting this information from the General settings in the Admin panel.

eSmart/esmart/scripts/esmart_wrapper is a binary executable used to update the system from the web interface. It has the setuid bit to permit it to be executed as root ('sudo update_esmart.sh initialize' sets the correct permissions and setuid). Since shell scripts cannot be setuid (ony binary files), the esmart_wrapper binay permits these operations to be executed as root by a non-root user (in this case, members of the group 'esmart'). You can audit the source code of eSmart/esmart/scripts/esmart_wrapper.c and if you want to ensure the binary is indeed compiled from that source, you may compile it yourself with the following command. Otherwise, the compiled binary is already included and no further action is needed.

```sudo gcc ~/eSmart/esmart/scripts/esmart_wrapper.c -o ~/eSmart/esmart/scripts/esmart_wrapper```


### HTTP Server Security

SSL certificates will be generated and stored at ~/eSmart/esmart/frontend/ssl_certs/ during the install process. If you want to use your own SSL certificates, replace them as they are named in this directory. [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free verified SSL certificates.

If using the auto-generated certificate, be aware that they will not be verified when visiting the https:// version of the WEB UI. You will receive warning messages about the security of your site unless you add the certificate to your browser's trusted list). 


### Daemon info

The status of the daemon's service can be checked

```sudo service esmart service```

The daemon can also be started manually if the systemd method above isn't used or an error needs to be debugged

```sudo ~/eSmart/esmart/esmart_daemon.py```

Also, use '-d' to log all debug messages to /var/log/esmart/esmart.log

```sudo ~/eSmart/esmart/esmart_daemon.py -d```


### Upgrading

If you already have eSmart installed (>=4.0.0), you can perform an upgrade to the latest version on github by either using the Admin/Update menu in the web UI (recommended) or by issuing the following command at the terminal. Note: You must be a member of the group 'esmart', else you will have to execute the following command as root. A log of the update process can be found at /var/log/esmart/esmartupdate.log

```~/eSmart/esmart/scripts/esmart_wrapper upgrade```

Upgrading the esmart database is performed automatically during the upgrade process, however it can also be performed manually with the following commands (Note: This does not create the database, only upgrade them. You must already have a database created in order to upgrade):

```cd ~/eSmart/databases```

```alembic upgrade head```

Refer to the [alembic documentation](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for other functions.



### Restoring Backups

A backup is made when the system is upgraded. If you need to restore a backup, do the following, changing the appropriate directory names:

```
sudo mv ~/eSmart ~/eSmart_old
sudo cp -a /var/eSmart-backups/eSmart-TIME-COMMIT ~/eSmart
sudo service esmart restart
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
